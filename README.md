# MBA-for-Groceries

# Purpose.
In this project, a process called the Market Basket Analysis is demonstrated on a groceries dataset using the Apriori algorithm.

## Description
Market Basket Analysis is a powerful tool for translating vast amounts of customer transactions and viewing data into simple rules for product promotion and recommendation. It allows us, for instances, identifying products that are frequently bought together and from there building recommendations based on this information (e.g., bundles to offer, which items to present close to each other, how to improve inventory management, which items to upsell).

Market Basket Analysis is also a tool that helps people save time and have fun.This tool can also be used to build recommendation engines such as the ones used by Netflix and Spotify.

### Dependencies
The libraries used for this analysis include the following:
+ pandas for manipulation and data wrangling.
+ matplotlib and seaborn for plotting graphs and chats
+ numpy for numerical calculations
+ mlxtend for the apriori algorithm
